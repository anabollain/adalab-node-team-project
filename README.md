## Project 4
# Awesome Profile Cards with Node JS, Express JS and SQL

Hi there! In this repository you will find the result of our **Final project for Module 4 - Promo Radia - Adalab**, created for the Node JS Module of **Adalab's Full Stack Development Bootcamp**. 

The exercise consisted on creating a server for an existing project previously developed with **React framework**, maintaining both the aesthetics and functionalities of the web application.

## Project Goals

- Consolidate and enhance knowledge of **Node JS** and **Express JS** to listen to the client's requests.
- Consolidate and enhance knowledge of **SQL** to work with a database and save the information received from the client side persistently.
- Consolidate and enhance knowledge of **API Rest** to know how to identify, structure and organize the communication between browser and server in an optimized way.
- To be capable of developing a **complete web application**, without the need to consult or request help from other development teams.
- To be capable of pushing an entire project to production, with both the **front-end** and **back-end**.
- Implement **Scrum** as our framework and use the **Agile** methodology for the project's organization and team communication. 

## Project Backlog

**Sprint 01**
- Create a basic server
- Create an API Rest to create user's cards
- Save card's into an array within the server

**Sprint 02**
- Create a static server
- Host our team's previous project developed with React in our server

**Sprint 03**
- Create a dynamic server and a template engine with Ejs to visualize created card's

**Sprint 04**
- Create a database with SQLite to store user's information
- Create a request to the database to get browser's data

## Description

The **Algebraic Profile Cards** responsive web application allows you to create a completely personalized contact card that you can share online. 

When visiting our site, you will first access the **Landing Page**. By clicking in the **Comenzar** button, it will lead you to the site where you will be able to create your card. 

To do so, you will find the following tools:

- A **design section** where you will be able to choose between three different color palettes.
- A **fill section** to introduce all your personal data, as well as a photo that identifies you. If you are feeling creative, you can also upload an animated GIF âœ¨.
- A **share section** where your personalized card will be created when clicking in the button if you have filled all previous fields. 
- A **preview card section** with a reset button, when clicking on it, all fields will empty and the site will be restored to its initial state.

Not only your card will be available within the **View card** button that will appear beneath the Share section, but you will also be able to share it via **Twitter**.

Our goal is to always improve your **experience**. To do so, you will notice that the card **updates** while you are filling the information, we want you to be able to see how your card will look before creating it. 

That's not all! If your browser closes by error or you exit and revisit the site, all the **filled information will still be available**. 

We hope you enjoy the experience! ðŸŽ‰

## Steps to follow if you want to use this project in your computer

This project has been developed with a React Starter Kit, where a series of pre-installed and pre-configured tools and dependencies are available to optimize and organize the project. 

To be able to work with it, you will have to follow the next steps:

1. Create your repository.
2. Copy all project files in the root file of your repository.
3. Open the shell command and install all necessary dependencies listed here below:

```bash
npm install
npm install node-sass
npm install react-router-dom
npm install compressorjs
npm install express
npm install cors
npm install nodemon
npm install ejs
```

4. Download SQLite Browser to be able to work with the created database. 

https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

4. Once all dependencies have been installed, you will be able to run the back-end project typing in the shell command:

```bash
npm start #script for node
npm run dev #script for nodemon
```

5. To run the front-end project, you will have to type in the command shell: 

```bash
cd web
npm start
```

6. If you want to update the front-end project into the back-end, you will have to type in the shell command: 

```bash
npm run publish-react
```

7. This command:
- Opens a new window in Google Chrome and shows the web application, just as the VS Code Live Server (Go Live) plugin does.
- While opened, it **observes** all the files within the `src/` file, so when any of them have been changed it will **refresh your page in Google Chrome**.
- It also **processess the files** HTML, Sass / Css and JSX so that the browser is able to read them. For instance:
    - It converts Sass into Css.
    - It converts JSX into HTML and Javascript.


## Final Result

You can have a look of the outcome in Github Pages: **[Coding Time](https://project-promo-r-module-4-team-9-production.up.railway.app/)**. 

We hope you enjoy it as much as we did ðŸ˜‰.
